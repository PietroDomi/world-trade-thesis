The underlying idea of the overall research was to study methods of network theory with the goal of applying them to the constructed dataset of import/export exchanges among countries. The purpose of this chapter is to show the results obtained and comment on the metrics and visualization that have been produced. What was done, therefore, is to use the cleaned, normalized data from Chapter \ref{ch:2data} and perform an analysis using the approaches described in Chapter \ref{ch:3methods}.
